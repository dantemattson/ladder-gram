# ladder-gram
## Year 3 - Advanced Algorithms
Problem description: "The goal of a ladder-gram is to transform a source word into the target word on the bottom rung in the least number of steps. During each step, you must replace one letter in the previous word so that a new word is formed, but without changing the positions of the other letters. All words must exist in the supplied dictionary (dictionary.txt). For example, we can achieve the alchemist's dream of changing LEAD to GOLD in 3 steps or HIDE to SEEK in 6 steps. Minimise the number of steps."
